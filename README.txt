## Overview
This C++ program, `project3.cpp`, serves as a maze solver. It requires `apollo.cpp` and `input.txt` files to be in the same directory for proper functioning.

## Prerequisites
- C++ compiler (e.g., g++)
- Terminal or command prompt access

## Instructions
1. Ensure that `apollo.cpp` and `input.txt` are located in the same directory as `project3.cpp`.

2. Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the files:
    ```
    cd path/to/directory
    ```

3. Compile the `project3.cpp` file using the following command:
    ```
    g++ project3.cpp -o maze
    ```

4. Run the compiled executable:
    ```
    ./maze
    ```

## Usage
- Upon execution, the program will read the `input.txt` file containing maze data and solve the maze accordingly.
- Follow on-screen prompts or output messages for further instructions or information.

## Notes
- If any issues arise during compilation or execution, ensure that all required files are in the correct location and that the C++ compiler is properly configured.
